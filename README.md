Bite-sized machine learning models built from the ground up using Python and Numpy - with practical examples to solidfy the theory behind the models. Use these Jupyter notebooks as learning resources to discover the inner workings of essential predictive algorithms.     

*This assumes you already have Python, Numpy, and Jupyter Notebooks successfully installed on your machine* 

## Installation
`$ git clone https://github.com/jissac/ScratchML`     
`cd ScratchML`   

## Logistic Regression 
We'll first build a logistic regression model from scratch and use that in a binary classification problem - predicting if an image contains a cat or a dog (CatsvsDogs_Logistic_Regression.ipynb). https://medium.com/@melodious/understanding-deep-neural-networks-from-first-principles-logistic-regression-bd2f01c9e263

### Cats vs. Dogs

**Instructions**: After following the installation steps above, download the train1.zip file from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data. The notebook will provide further instructions on how to divide the files into the training and test folders.
