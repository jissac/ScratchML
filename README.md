# ScratchML
Bite-sized machine learning models built from the ground up using Python and Numpy - with practical examples to solidfy the theory behind the models. Use these Jupyter notebooks as learning resources to discover the inner workings of essential predictive algorithms.

## Installation Instructions
`$ git clone https://github.com/jissac/ScratchML`     
`cd ScratchML`   

Then download data from 

## Cats vs. Dogs
<p align="center"> <img src="./images/cat.1.jpg">      <img src="/images/dog.10682.jpg" </p>

We'll first build a logistic regression model from scratch and use that in a binary classification problem - predicting if an image contains a cat or a dog (CatsvsDogs_Logistic_Regression.ipynb).    

We'll then expand the logistic regression model to build a 2-layer neural network from scratch and see how performance improves on the cats vs. dogs prediction.
