Bite-sized machine learning models built using Python, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow - with practical examples to solidfy the theory behind the models. Use these Jupyter notebooks as learning resources to discover the inner workings of essential predictive algorithms.     

## Installation
`$ git clone https://github.com/jissac/ScratchML`     
`cd ScratchML`   

### Logistic Regression 
We'll build a logistic regression model from scratch in Python and use it in a binary classification problem - predicting if an image contains a cat or a dog:

### Convolutional Neural Net  
We'll then extend the binary image cat vs. dog classification task to a CNN architecture:

### Support Vector Machines  
We'll use the Iris dataset to understand how SVMs can be used for classification

We'll extend the application of SVMs on the Gender Recognition by Voice dataset

Let's use SVMs for image classification on the Fashion dataset

### Decision Trees
We'll use the basic Iris dataset to understand how Decision Trees can be used for classification

## Datasets
Datasets used in this repository.
### Gender Recognition by Voice
A collection of recorded voice samples from male and female speakers. [Hosted by Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/primaryobjects/voicegender)
### Cats vs. Dogs
A subset of data from the Microsoft Research team [hosted by Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) with images that contain either cats or dogs.
### Iris Dataset
A [classic dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) comparing the structural variation of three related Iris flower species - Iris-setosa, Iris-Versicolor, and Iris-Virginica.
