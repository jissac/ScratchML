# ScratchML
Bite-sized machine learning models built from the ground up using Python and Numpy - with practical examples to solidfy the theory behind the models. Use these Jupyter notebooks as learning resources to discover the inner workings of essential predictive algorithms.

## Installation
`$ git clone https://github.com/jissac/ScratchML`     
`cd ScratchML`

## Cats vs. Dogs
We'll first build a logistic regression model from scratch and use that in a binary classification problem - predicting if an image contains a cat or a dog.    

We'll then expand the logistic regression model to build a 2-layer neural network from scratch and see how performane improves on the cats vs. dogs prediction.
